# Weekend SQL Task List



## Description
Duration: Weekend - 12 hours

This full stack application allows the user to create tasks, mark them as completed and delete finished tasks. When tasks are marked as complete, the time the complete button was clicked logs the time so the user can see when the task was finished. When the user selects to delete a task, a smart alert will pop up to confirm that the user truly wishes to delete the task from the list.
